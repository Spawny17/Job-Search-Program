# Job-Search-Program
A small project with web scraping through job websites

This is a small project I decided to take on after thinking of ways I can automate a daily task. As I'm looking for a junior role in web development each day I thought making a script to automate some of this would be good practice. 

It currently has two job websites that it scrapes, looking for jobs within the last 3 days of posting and exports all of the results into a .csv file for ease of viewing. It exports the job title and the link to the job page at the moment. This is the first version and I will be adding more to it. 

Updated 13/08/19: 
Added a job search for the reed.co.uk job website, searching the last 3 days worth of job listings. 

Future Improvements 
- Add more job search websites
- Need to improve on the output of the Indeed jobs exported as the job title has a lot of spaces before each one
- Improve the code and structure of the script
- Add more information such as date posted so any duplicates can be removed
